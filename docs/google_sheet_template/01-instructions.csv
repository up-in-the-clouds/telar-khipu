Welcome,"Welcome to the Telar Google Sheets template! This spreadsheet is your authoring interface for creating digital storytelling exhibitions with IIIF images."
Overview,"This template has 5 tabs (or more if you add additional chapters):
• Instructions (this tab) - Reference guide
• Project Setup - Site configuration and chapter list
• Objects - Collection metadata
• Glossary - Term definitions
• Chapter 1+ - Story steps (add more chapter tabs as needed)"
Getting Started,"1. Fill in the Project Setup tab with your exhibition information
2. Add your collection objects to the Objects tab
3. Define glossary terms in the Glossary tab
4. Create story steps in each Chapter tab
5. Publish to web as CSV (File → Share → Publish to web)
6. Add published URL to your GitHub repository secrets"
Data Format,"• Use UTF-8 encoding for special characters
• Column headers are case-sensitive - don't change them
• Don't leave empty rows between data rows
• Object IDs must match exactly between tabs
• File paths should start with /assets/
• External IIIF manifests should be complete info.json URLs"
Coordinates,"For x, y coordinates in chapter steps:
• Use decimal numbers between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.5)
• x = horizontal position (0=left, 1=right)
• y = vertical position (0=top, 1=bottom)
• zoom = zoom level (1=full view, higher numbers zoom in)"
File Sizes,"Keep individual files under 2MB for best performance:
• Images: JPEG at 85-90% quality, max 2000px width
• Use thumbnails in Objects tab, not full images
• Generate IIIF tiles for high-resolution images
• External IIIF manifests have no size limit"
IIIF Manifests,"You can use either local images or IIIF manifests:
• Local: Place images in /assets/images/objects/
• IIIF: Use complete info.json URL in iiif_manifest column
• IIIF enables deep zoom and better performance for large images"
Publishing,"To publish your sheet:
1. File → Share → Publish to web
2. Choose: Entire Document, CSV format
3. Check: Automatically republish when changes are made
4. Copy the published URL
5. Add to GitHub: Settings → Secrets → GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL"
GID Values,"Each tab has a unique GID number:
• Click on each tab and look at the URL
• Note the #gid=123456789 value
• Update these in .github/workflows/build.yml
• GIDs change if you reorder tabs - always get fresh values"
