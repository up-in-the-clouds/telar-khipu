    "layer1_text": "<p>Khipus or fiber recording devices have been used for more than a thousand years in the central Andes (what today is Perú) however their function, structure and significance has changed over time. The earliest known khipus were used by the Wari culture in the 8th century CE. It is under the Inka empire in the 15th century that the first indication of a standardized khipu form began to be used. \\n\\nHowever, there are major gaps in modern knowledge about how khipus operated. The Spanish, arriving in the 16th century paid little attention to khipus, and in many places forced the abandonment of this practice along with moving many peoples from their traditional lands and attempted suppression of Indigenous ideas.  Modern researchers have relied on Colonial sources and the few communities in the mountains of the Andes who have continued to use khipus for different purposes to better understand the information contained in khipu and their meaning to Andean peoples. Colonial sources inform us that khipus were created by khipucamayocs under the Inka empire, suggesting this was a specialized skill. Recent research suggests that more people may have kept khipus during the Inka empire than previously thought.<br />\n<img alt=\"Primary source\" src=\"/components/images/objects/02.jpg\" /></p>",
    "layer2_title": "About this study",
    "layer2_text": "<p>Despite many years in the AD&amp;A Museum's collection, the khipu had not formally been studied. In this project we undertook study of the khipu to learn its object history and try to understand when and how it may have been used - as well as inform others about its existence. We have shared our information with the Khipu Field Guide which maintains an open access database of studied khipus across the world.</p>"
