    "layer1_text": "<p>Khipus or fiber recording devices have been used for more than a thousand years in the central Andes (what today is Perú) however their function, structure and significance has changed over time. The earliest known khipus were used by the Wari culture in the 8th century CE. It is under the Inka empire in the 15th century that the first indication of a standardized khipu form began to be used. \\n\\nHowever, there are major gaps in modern knowledge about how khipus operated. The Spanish, arriving in the 16th century paid little attention to khipus, and in many places forced the abandonment of this practice along with moving many peoples from their traditional lands and attempted suppression of Indigenous ideas.  Modern researchers have relied on Colonial sources and the few communities in the mountains of the Andes who have continued to use khipus for different purposes to better understand the information contained in khipu and their meaning to Andean peoples. Colonial sources inform us that khipus were created by khipucamayocs under the Inka empire, suggesting this was a specialized skill. Recent research suggests that more people may have kept khipus during the Inka empire than previously thought.<br />\n<img alt=\"Primary source\" src=\"/components/images/objects/02.jpg\" /></p>",

    "layer2_text": "<p>Despite many years in the AD&amp;A Museum's collection, the khipu had not formally been studied. In this project we undertook study of the khipu to learn its object history and try to understand when and how it may have been used - as well as inform others about its existence. We have shared our information with the Khipu Field Guide which maintains an open access database of studied khipus across the world.</p>"

    "layer1_text": "<p>The attachment and organization of the pendant cords of the khipu on the primary, or main cord, is intentional and organized. 20th and 21st century oral histories from Andean highland community members indicate how. These accounts tell us that the different clusters of knots and the variation of colored cords is a means to record the contributions of specific allyu, or communities in a certain area. There is also likely significance of the different colors of cordage, including the multi-colored, or mottled cords. Watch the videos below to learn more about different knot types on khipu and how they are created.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/unkVyxbuYKw?si=Trz1SsV2fQaL1tFA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkpAY-wmjoc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enDhXD60Omo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>All three knot types are tied by wrapping loops around a finger. Single knots are created by looping a cord around the index finger, passing the running end of the cord through the loop, and then pulling the loop tight after it’s been removed from the finger. Long knots are made in a very similar fashion. The key difference is that multiple loops would be wrapped around the finger in the first step, rather than only a single loop. The number of loops corresponds to the numerical value of the long knot. The figure eight knot once again begins with a loop around the index finger, but this time, the second loop is created by crossing the running end back over the first loop instead of wrapping it beside the first loop as would be done in a long knot. When the running end is passed through the first loop again, the two loops form a figure eight. [ADD photo] Counting the cords on a khipu means looking at knot types as well as where the knots are placed on a cords. The upper section of a khipu cord contains only single knots, which represent values in multiples of 10. The lower section of the cord consists of figure eight and long knots. Figure eight knots denote a value of 1, and long knots denote values 2 through 9. The values in the upper and lower registers on a cord are added together to get the value of the cord as a whole. For example, this cord from the UCSB khipu can be read as having a value of 44 since it has 4 single knots in the upper register and a 4 long knot in the lower register.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Khipu close up\" src=\"/assets/images/07.webp\" /></p>",
