    "answer": "Take a close look at this khipu (key-pu), now in the AD&A Museum at UC Santa Barbara. At first glance, this khipu may appear to be a tangled grouping of fiber cords yet it is a recording device made of fibers and knots used by the people of South America. Analysis of the khipu, its materials, organization of cords, knots, and technical studies such as radiocarbon dating tells us about the information contained in this khipu, this khipu’s story and how it served Andean peoples. (mention all the types of analysis, which the reader will learn more about in other part of the exhibition).",

    "layer1_text": "<p>Khipus or fiber recording devices have been used for more than a thousand years in the central Andes (what today is Perú) however their function, structure and significance has changed over time. The earliest known khipus were used by the Wari culture in the 8th century CE. It is under the Inka empire in the 15th century that the first indication of a standardized khipu form began to be used. \\n\\nHowever, there are major gaps in modern knowledge about how khipus operated. The Spanish, arriving in the 16th century paid little attention to khipus, and in many places forced the abandonment of this practice along with moving many peoples from their traditional lands and attempted suppression of Indigenous ideas.  Modern researchers have relied on Colonial sources and the few communities in the mountains of the Andes who have continued to use khipus for different purposes to better understand the information contained in khipu and their meaning to Andean peoples. Colonial sources inform us that khipus were created by khipucamayocs under the Inka empire, suggesting this was a specialized skill. Recent research suggests that more people may have kept khipus during the Inka empire than previously thought.<br />\n<img alt=\"Primary source\" src=\"/components/images/objects/02.jpg\" /></p>",

    "question": "How do we read a khipu? ",
    "answer": "Today we are accustomed to written words, numbers, and books to share stories, accounting, and census information. To understand khipus, we need to first familiarize ourselves with its different cordage features. Khipus are made with natural materials most often fibers, such as cotton or camelid wool. Interact with the image to learn more about its main features, cord and knot types. Information coding in khipus begins with the construction of the cords.",

    "layer1_text": "<p>The attachment and organization of the pendant cords of the khipu on the primary, or main cord, is intentional and organized. 20th and 21st century oral histories from Andean highland community members indicate how. These accounts tell us that the different clusters of knots and the variation of colored cords is a means to record the contributions of specific allyu, or communities in a certain area. There is also likely significance of the different colors of cordage, including the multi-colored, or mottled cords. Watch the videos below to learn more about different knot types on khipu and how they are created.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/unkVyxbuYKw?si=Trz1SsV2fQaL1tFA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkpAY-wmjoc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enDhXD60Omo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>All three knot types are tied by wrapping loops around a finger. Single knots are created by looping a cord around the index finger, passing the running end of the cord through the loop, and then pulling the loop tight after it’s been removed from the finger. Long knots are made in a very similar fashion. The key difference is that multiple loops would be wrapped around the finger in the first step, rather than only a single loop. The number of loops corresponds to the numerical value of the long knot. The figure eight knot once again begins with a loop around the index finger, but this time, the second loop is created by crossing the running end back over the first loop instead of wrapping it beside the first loop as would be done in a long knot. When the running end is passed through the first loop again, the two loops form a figure eight. [ADD photo] Counting the cords on a khipu means looking at knot types as well as where the knots are placed on a cords. The upper section of a khipu cord contains only single knots, which represent values in multiples of 10. The lower section of the cord consists of figure eight and long knots. Figure eight knots denote a value of 1, and long knots denote values 2 through 9. The values in the upper and lower registers on a cord are added together to get the value of the cord as a whole. For example, this cord from the UCSB khipu can be read as having a value of 44 since it has 4 single knots in the upper register and a 4 long knot in the lower register.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Khipu close up\" src=\"/components/images/objects/07.webp\" /></p>",
    "layer2_title": "Materials and More",
    "layer2_text": "<p>Materials in Khipus: Khipu from the late Inka and early colonial era are made of natural materials, including natural fibers, like cotton, and natural dyes. These dyes are sourced from roots, minerals, and other plant life in the Andes. Another unique material sometimes found in this khipu is human hair. Within many Andean cultural traditions, hair holds a symbolic importance. According to new research in anthropology, the presence of hair in khipu cords is likely from the khipukamaoq, or maker of the khipu and, or individuals connected to the information in the khipu.\\nSpin direction and Ply: Spin direction and Ply: Based on the direction they are plied, cords have an S or Z spin.The spin direction and ply of the cords can denote additional meaning to what is encoded on each cord through knots and placement. Cords are created by first spinning the material–often cotton or wool–in one direction to create a single strand. Next, 2+ single strands are wrapped, or “plied,” together in the opposite direction to form the finished cord. Using 2 singles is most common, but more than 2 can be plied together, as is the case with the 3-ply primary cord on the khipu at UCSB. Khipu cords can either be classified as having an S or Z ply. An S-plied cord is made of single strands that are spun clockwise (Z-spun). The Z-spun singles are then plied counterclockwise to create the S-plied cord. The inverse is true of Z-plied cords.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Researcher at the lab with khipu\" src=\"/components/images/objects/08.webp\" /></p>"

These 9 clusters of cords may have recorded census and tribute information related to different communities. Looking closely, some of the clusters contain many knots and knot types, while the cords in other clusters have fewer knots, or none at all. This speaks to the continual use and re-use of khipu to record and update information.

The goal was to preserve as much knot and cord detail as possible, but conventional 3D scanners initially had trouble capturing that much detail on such a small scale. Our scanner had trouble differentiating between the khipu and the board it is mounted on. Essentially, the scanner thinks of the khipu and the board as one object. With other objects, we could flip the object to scan the backside and then merge the models, but because the khipu is mounted to the board, this is not possible here. This means that we can capture a high-quality scan of the exposed side of the khipu, but not the side facing the board.</p>\n<p>The scanning process itself was long and required numerous passes over the khipu due to the dense clustering of cords. One cord is packed with topographical information, which the scanner detects. The twists and turns of the spun cords and complex knots create innumerable peaks and valleys for the scanner to process. When these cords are viewed together, the amount of information that the scanner has to work with is enormous.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Khipu close up\" src=\"/components/images/objects/09.webp\" /></p>",

Radiocarbon calibration curves, there is one for the northern hemisphere and another for the southern hemisphere are developed from known ages – tree rings have been an important source for developing calibration curves as most trees attain a tree ring every year of their life, allowing for the determination of the tree’s age along with the amount of radiocarbon.

Hyperspectral imaging records data across narrow spectral bands, extending into ultraviolet and infrared ranges invisible to us. Applied to a khipu, it can reveal minute dye variations, fiber types, surface residues, and signs of repair, yielding precise, non-invasive insights into its materials, construction, and cultural history. Performing these two forms of technical analysis on this Khipu, however, offered little insight beyond what is initially observable.
