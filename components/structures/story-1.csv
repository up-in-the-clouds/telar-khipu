1,"When you see this khipu (key-pu) what do you notice? What can we learned from it?","Take a close look at this khipu (key-pu), now in the AD&A Museum at UC Santa Barbara. At first glance, this khipu may appear to be a tangled grouping of fiber cords yet it is a recording device made of fibers and knots used by the people of South America. Analysis of the khipu, its materials, organization of cords, knots, and technical studies such as radiocarbon dating tells us about the information contained in this khipu, this khipu’s story and how it served Andean peoples. (mention all the types of analysis, which the reader will learn more about in other part of the exhibition).","img01",0.5,0.5,1,"","story1/step1-layer1.md","","story1/step1-layer2.md"
2,"Where is this khipu from? How did it arrive at UC Santa Barbara?","The AD&A khipu's provenance or its object history has large gaps. Radiocarbon dating indicates the khipu was created between 1500 and 1632 somewhere in the Inka Empire. It became part of the collection of the Art, Design and Architecture (AD&A) Museum at UC Santa Barbara in 1966. Explore this online exhibition to learn more about how to read khipu, and the various methods of analysis used to study and interpret khipu.","img03",0.5,0.5,1,"","story1/step2-layer1.md","","story1/step2-layer2.md"
3,"How do we read a khipu? ","Today we are accustomed to written words, numbers, and books to share stories, accounting, and census information. To understand khipus, we need to first familiarize ourselves with its different cordage features. Khipus are made with natural materials most often fibers, such as cotton or camelid wool. Interact with the image to learn more about its main features, cord and knot types. Information coding in khipus begins with the construction of the cords.","img06",0.5,0.5,1,"","story1/step3-layer1.md","","story1/step3-layer2.md"
4,"How do we read UCSB's AD&A Khipu?","Close study of the khipu suggests it was used as a census and possible tributary recording during the Inka or early Colonial period. Composed of brown and cream colored cotton, some mottled, the khipu was mounted to a canvas backing in the reverse, showing us the “back” of the object.

5,"Studying a Khipu (technical analysis-carbon dating)","Radiocarbon dating informs us that this khipu was in use between 1502-1643, a period of time that encompasses both the Inca empire and the early colonial period.  We took small samples of about 5 mg from two cords, the primary cord and a pendant cord for radiocarbon dating. See where we took the samples from in the photo.","img10",0.5,0.5,1,"","story1/step5-layer1.md","",""
6,"Seeing beyond the spectral: Ultraviolet and Hyperspectral analysis","Ultraviolet (UV) light analysis can reveal features of a khipu invisible in normal lighting, but what hidden stories emerge when we look beyond what our eyes can see? Hyperspectral analysis of a 16th-century khipu allows one to potentially detect subtle variations in dyes, fibers, and residues that are invisible to the naked eye. This non-invasive method provides new insights into the artifact’s materials, construction, and use, deepening understanding of its historical and cultural significance. See what we learned when performing this analysis.","img12",0.5,0.5,1,"","story1/step6-layer1.md","",""
