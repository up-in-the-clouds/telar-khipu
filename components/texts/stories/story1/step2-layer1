The khipu was collected by Dr. Thomas Harper Goodspeed, a botanist at UC Berkeley, who undertook six scientific expeditions to Peru & Chile in the 1930s and ‘40s. The expeditions were part of Goodspeed’s research on indigenous plants from Peru. Goodspeed likely acquired the khipu and other parts of his collection during an expedition.
