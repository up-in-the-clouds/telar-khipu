title: Materials and More

Materials in Khipus: Khipu from the late Inka and early colonial era are made of natural materials, including natural fibers, like cotton, and natural dyes. These dyes are sourced from roots, minerals, and other plant life in the Andes. Another unique material sometimes found in this khipu is human hair. Within many Andean cultural traditions, hair holds a symbolic importance. According to new research in anthropology, the presence of hair in khipu cords is likely from the khipukamaoq, or maker of the khipu and, or individuals connected to the information in the khipu.\nSpin direction and Ply: Spin direction and Ply: Based on the direction they are plied, cords have an S or Z spin.The spin direction and ply of the cords can denote additional meaning to what is encoded on each cord through knots and placement. Cords are created by first spinning the material–often cotton or wool–in one direction to create a single strand. Next, 2+ single strands are wrapped, or “plied,” together in the opposite direction to form the finished cord. Using 2 singles is most common, but more than 2 can be plied together, as is the case with the 3-ply primary cord on the khipu at UCSB. Khipu cords can either be classified as having an S or Z ply. An S-plied cord is made of single strands that are spun clockwise (Z-spun). The Z-spun singles are then plied counterclockwise to create the S-plied cord. The inverse is true of Z-plied cords.
