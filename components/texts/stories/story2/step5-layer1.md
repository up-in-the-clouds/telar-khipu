title: Pan and Zoom Control
---

Telar gives you precise control over what your reader sees. Each story step defines x, y coordinates and zoom level.

For example, this image features portrait medallions of seven supposed indigenous rulers of the Muisca before the Spanish invasion (Sacuan, Sugamuxi, Nemeguene, Vbaqui, Saquesazippa, Thysquesuca, and Guatabita). You might pan and zoom into each and then provide panels like these with more information at each step.
