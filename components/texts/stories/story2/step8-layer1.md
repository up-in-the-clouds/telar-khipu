With Telar, you can weave together materials from multiple institutions to tell rich, multifaceted stories. Combine maps, paintings, photographs, manuscripts, and artifacts - switching seamlessly between objects and zoom levels to build compelling narrative arcs.

This example showcases transitions between external repositories (Huntington, JCB) and local IIIF tiles, demonstrating how flexible Telar is for scholarly storytelling.
