title: Your Own Materials
---

You don't need to rely only on institutional collections - **Telar can work with your own images**.

**How it works:**
1. Place high-resolution images in `components/images/objects/`
2. Telar automatically generates IIIF tiles during the build process
3. Your images get the same zoom and pan capabilities as materials from major institutions

**The result:** This ceramic figure uses locally-generated IIIF tiles, while the previous map came from the Huntington Library. Notice how they work seamlessly together - readers can't tell the difference.

**Mix and match:** Combine your own photographs, documents, and artifacts with materials from museums and archives worldwide to tell rich, multi-source stories.
