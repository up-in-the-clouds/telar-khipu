---

Telar panels support **full Markdown syntax** for rich text formatting:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- _Italic text_ for nuance
- [External links](https://iiif.io) to resources
- Numbered and bulleted lists

Block quotations, like this: 
> This gold figure, dating from 600-1600 CE, is an example of the Muisca's sophisticated _metalworking techniques_.[^1]

You can even include footnotes[^2] for citations and references.

[^1]: The Museo del Oro in Bogot√° holds extensive collections of these artifacts.
[^2]: Footnotes appear at the bottom of panel content with proper styling.
