title: IIIF Compatibility
---

Telar is built on **IIIF** (International Image Interoperability Framework), an open standard that makes it easy to deliver, view, and annotate high-resolution images on the web.

**Why IIIF matters:**
- Access images from thousands of cultural heritage institutions worldwide
- Work with materials from museums, libraries, and archives
- No need to download or store large image files
- Images remain on the institution's servers with proper attribution

**This map** comes from the Huntington Library's IIIF collection and loads seamlessly in Telar.

**Find IIIF resources:**
- [IIIF Guide to Finding Resources](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) - Discover collections
- [IIIF Community](https://iiif.io/community/) - Connect with institutions
- [IIIF Cookbook](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/) - Technical recipes

Telar works with any IIIF-compliant repository - simply paste the manifest URL.
