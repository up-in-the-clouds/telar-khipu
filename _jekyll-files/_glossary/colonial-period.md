The Colonial Period in the Americas began with Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492 and lasted until the independence movements of the early 19th century. This era was characterized by Spanish territorial expansion, the establishment of administrative structures, and profound cultural exchange between European, Indigenous, and African populations.
