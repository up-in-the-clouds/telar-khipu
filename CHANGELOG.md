# Changelog

All notable changes to Telar will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **Scrolling system overhaul**: Replaced Scrollama library with custom discrete step-based card stacking architecture to enable **multiple IIIF objects within a single story**. Each object gets its own preloaded viewer card that slides up/down as users navigate through steps.
- **Animation timing**: Reduced viewer pan/zoom animation duration from 36 seconds to 4 seconds for more natural pacing
- **Cleaner viewer UI**: Hidden UniversalViewer color picker and adjustment panels for distraction-free viewing

### Fixed

- **Critical navigation bug**: Fixed viewer cards getting stuck or invisible after backward→forward navigation cycles
- **Z-index layering**: Resolved issue where reused viewer cards appeared behind currently visible cards
- **State management**: Added complete state reset when reusing viewer cards (clears inline styles, transitions, opacity)
- **Intro handling**: Improved viewer reference management when navigating to/from story intro

### Added

- **Story 2 showcase**: Added comprehensive demo story with rich media examples (images, videos, markdown formatting)
- **Enhanced logging**: Improved console debugging messages for bounds checking and state transitions

## [0.1.1-beta] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

- Fixed IIIF thumbnails loading at low resolution on home and objects pages by extracting 400px canvas images instead of tiny thumbnail properties
- Fixed markdown syntax not rendering in panels by adding markdown-to-HTML conversion in csv_to_json.py script
- Added comprehensive footnote styling for both panel layers with proper contrast and visual hierarchy
- Added markdown module to requirements.txt for GitHub Actions CI/CD compatibility
- Fixed image URLs in slide-over panels not working when site is deployed to subdirectories by automatically detecting and prepending the base URL
